# Technical Analysis and Suggested Improvements

This document lists possible optimizations and enhancements for **Torwell84** based on the current architecture.

## 1. Backend Efficiency
- **Go modules**: use minimal modules and build tags for each platform to avoid unused code in the final binary.
- **Connection pooling**: maintain persistent HTTP connections where possible to reduce latency for repeated REST calls.
- **Asynchronous logging**: buffer log writes and flush in the background to reduce blocking during high load. This is now implemented via a goroutine in `logWriter`.
- **Torrc validation**: when a custom `torrc` is uploaded, run `tor --verify-config` and return errors before restarting Tor. This prevents invalid settings from breaking the connection.
- **Config persistence**: expose `/config` endpoints storing OBFS4 and pre-warming flags in `config.json` so they survive restarts.

## 2. Frontend Enhancements
- **State management**: leverage Svelte stores for reactive updates and to keep UI state minimal.
- **Lazy loading**: load heavy components (e.g., logs modal) only when needed to keep initial startup quick.
- **GPU usage**: limit overdraw and keep the DOM hierarchy shallow so that the VisionOS effects remain smooth on weaker devices.

## 3. Cloudflare Worker Management
- **Automated failover**: already planned, but could also include tracking response times and preferring the fastest worker.
- **Endpoint import/export**: allow users to export their configured worker list and share it across devices.

## 4. Additional Features
- **Integrated updates**: optional auto-updater fetching new binaries from a signed release feed.
- **Tray icon**: small helper process for quick connect/disconnect without opening the full UI.
- **Dark/light theme**: switchable VisionOS-style themes for better accessibility.

## 5. Hardware and Network Optimization
- **AVX2/NEON builds**: compile with architecture-specific flags for better crypto throughput.
- **BBRv2**: the server now attempts to enable the BBRv2 congestion control algorithm on Linux at startup.
- **In-memory caching**: a `dnsCache` module keeps DNS lookups in RAM for quick reuse.
- **TLS 1.3**: use modern ciphers (ChaCha20-Poly1305/AES-GCM) for proxy connections.
- **IP monitoring**: detect changes of local interfaces and gracefully reconnect if needed.

## 6. Security Considerations
- **Sandboxing**: run the embedded Tor process with restricted permissions and separate data directories per platform.
- **Code signing**: sign all release binaries to prevent tampering.
- **Network hardening**: verify TLS certificates when talking to Cloudflare Worker endpoints and use pinned keys if possible.

These points are optional extensions on top of the current design in `TargetPicture.md` and can help improve usability, performance, and security.
